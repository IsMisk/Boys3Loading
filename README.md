# Boys+3 Club String Loading
This repository is for a VRChat world to String Load from trusted URL source. Basically just so you don't need to enable untrusted URLs in Settings. >:3

## Purpose
While the primary utility lies in the URL string loading, this repo may also include:

- Examples snippets / Code used in the world
- Documentation on specific implementations
- Miscellaneous resources related to the VRChat world

## Why Use Trusted URLs?
In VRChat, enabling untrusted URLs can pose security risks. By relying on trusted URL sources, this project ensures that:

- You can't claim I'm hacking you
- Users don't need to enable a potentially unsafe feature even tho most ppl have it on anyway :P

## Repository Contents
At the moment, there is little reason to explore this repository unless you are curious about the following:

- Example implementations or proof-of-concept scripts
- Code used for the VRChat world
- Other related documents or resources

## Contribution
While contributions are welcome, the main purpose of this repo is just to do string loading for a VRChat world. If you have ideas, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to contact me on X or something idk.
